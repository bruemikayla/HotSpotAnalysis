# HotSpotAnalysis
Code adapted from Heatherlee Leary, determining hot spots of sample points using Gi statistics. Code adjusted for point geometry instead of shape geometry. 

Original code can be found here: https://rpubs.com/heatherleeleary/hotspot_getisOrd_tut

Point statistics best used when longitudinal and latitude coordinates were acquired with samples.
